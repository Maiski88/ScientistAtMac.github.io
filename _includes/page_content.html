                     <p>
                 Science Faculty is the most diverse faculty at McMaster University; </p>
                 <p>8 departments covering everything from music cognition to theoretical physics. A group of us saw this diversity and lack of communication platforms between programs. We also saw great opportunities in bringing scientists from diverse fields together to make a difference in graduate student life at McMaster. </p>
                <p>Do you want to know whatâ€™s happening in other science departments at the opposite side of the campus? </p>
                <p>Do you want to see more options for your scientific career opportunities? </p>
