                 Currently, my research is looking at how performers’ interpretations of musical pieces influence how listeners are able to perceive emotion. Many researchers have studied how emotion is communicated in music, and have uncovered how structural aspects (cues such as tempo, or whether a piece is in the major or minor key) of musical pieces help us identify expressed emotions (Hevner 1935, Livingstone, Muhlberger, Brown, & Thompson, 2010; Thompson & Robitaille, 1992). When performing a musical piece, performers have the wonderful ability to include their own expressive actions, thus varying these musical or acoustic cues (Gabrielsson and Juslin 1996). As a result, this variation may impact what is being conveyed! In addition, the expressive performance of a piece will change from performer to performer, so a listener’s experience will therefore change across performers. My research hopes to investigate these variations and how it changes listeners’ perceived emotion.</p>

                <p>
                Everyone can relate to music in some way, and at one point or another everyone connects to the emotional aspect of it. I have always felt passionate about music, both as a listener and an amateur musician. I love this research because it is addressing what it is about music that makes it so valuable to us: the emotion. It’s a complicated topic to study, but with consideration to its importance and ubiquity, emotion in music is such a fascinating and worthwhile topic.
