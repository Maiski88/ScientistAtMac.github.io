 Have you found yourself walking down a hallway saying "Who was that?"

SAM helps us all connect with each other through fun social events that are full of opportunities to meet science grads of own&other departments, alumni and potential employers in industry.
You will be invited to all events; fun social at the Phoenix, wine & cheese with alumni, to name a few. You will be surprised how much opportunities you have as a Science grad at McMaster.
